      <p class="body-text" style="margin-bottom: 30px">
        So far, we have created the webpage, implemented the scrollyteller, and established
       some structure to the webpage. We have cleaned the data so that we can retrieve statistics for each combination of

        exit velocity and launch angle. We created the baseball field, and added sliders below the baseball diamond so that you can
        change the exit velocity and launch angle. We included a brief introduction to the project, along
        with our overall objectives.

    <h2 class="centered" style="margin-bottom: 15px">What will be the most challenging:</h2>
      <p class='body-text' style="margin-bottom: 30px">
        The most challenging part of our design will probably be connecting the data from
        our Jupyter Notebook to the interactive visualization. Our goal is to create text boxes when you hover over a base which
        show the number of singles, doubles, triples, or home runs for the combination of exit velocity and launch angle. We also
        want to color encode the bases so that it represents the likelihood of a hit getting on that particular base. This will be difficult as we will need to calculate coordinates, and figure out how to change the statistics based on the hovered base.
