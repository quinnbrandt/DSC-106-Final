  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="body-text">
    Baseball is one of the leading sports in the collection and usage of data. Two of the newer metrics which have
    gained popularity are Exit Velocity (EV) and Launch Angle (LA). Exit velocity
    is the speed (in mph) that the ball is travelling directly after contact. Launch angle is the angle
    (in degrees) that the ball is travelling after the initial contact. There is some additional vocabulary
    that will be used throughout this project. The first of which is BBE or batted ball event is any
    time a ball is hit that occurs in an out, a hit, or an error. wOBA or weighted on-base average 
    measures the value of each method of reaching base based on how much it changes projected runs scored.
  </p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p class = "body-text">
    The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between EV, LA, and the outcomes that they 
    produce. In the graphic below, use the sliders to pick a desired EV and LA combination to inspect. If there
    were any recorded instances of that combination during the 2023 season, the box to the side will have a full breakdown
    of the statistics. Additionally you can see the percentage of BBEs that result in each of the bases by hovering over them.
