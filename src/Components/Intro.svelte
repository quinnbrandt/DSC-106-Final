  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="body-text">
    Baseball is one of the leading sports in the collection and usage of data. Two of the newer metrics which have
    gained popularity are Exit Velocity (EV) and Launch Angle (LA). Exit velocity
    is the speed (in mph) that the ball is travelling directly after contact. Launch angle is the angle
    (in degrees) that the ball is travelling after the initial contact. There is some additional vocabulary
    that will be used throughout this project. The first of which is BBE or batted ball event is any
    time a ball is hit that occurs in an out, a hit, or an error. wOBA or weighted on-base average 
    measures the value of each method of reaching base based on how much it changes projected runs scored.
  </p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p class = "body-text">
    The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between EV, LA, and the outcomes that they 
    produce. We will do this by creating a graphic that takes in two inputs and returns the data collected 
    from the 2023 season as it regards to the inputs.
